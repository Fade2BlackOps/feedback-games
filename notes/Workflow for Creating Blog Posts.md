1. Create new Markdown File
    - Inside `_posts/` directory
    - Name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`

2. Add Front Matter
- Every post needs front matter at the top to define its properties. 

Example:
```
---
layout: post
title: "Another Awesome Post"
date: 2025-03-22
author: Your Name
categories: [Tech, Jekyll]
tags: [jekyll, web-dev, blogging]
---
```
- layout: post → Uses the post layout.
- categories: → Organizes posts into sections.
- tags: → Helps with filtering content later.

3. Write Your Content
Use Markdown formatting, and just write what you want to write in there 🖊️

4. Commit and Push to Git/GitHub
You know how to do that 😄
